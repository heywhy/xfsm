# XFsm

XFsm is a declarative finite state machine library for [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

It uses [event-driven](./docs/transitions.md) programming, [state machines](./docs/state-machines.md) and actors to handle complex logic in predictable and robust ways.

It provides very easy to use APIs which makes looking at a declaration very easy to understand.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `xfsm` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
